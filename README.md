# ChIP-seq-on-FOXA2-TF

Data analysis on ChIP-seq data targeting FOXA2 transcription factor, starting from the two raw bam files of both replicates of FOXA2 transcription factor. 

The post processing of this analysis was done using seqminer, in order to to investigate the distribution of the enrichment of the h2k4me1 histone modification, GREAT, a tool useful to analyze the functional significance of cis-regulatory regions identified by locaclized measurements of dna binding events across an entire genome, and Pscan-ChIP, a web application that, given a set of genomic regions derived from a genome wide ChIP-Seq experiment, scans them and looks for over represented sequence motifs.
